# Hi there, I'm Mahammad Ibrahimli 👋
### Full-Stack Software Developer  
**Backend & API Architecture Focus**

I build scalable, secure, and maintainable backend systems with Java Spring Boot and modern interactive frontends with TypeScript & React.

My main interest lies in designing systems — not just writing code.
